# Contributor guidelines for "FAIR Phytoliths: Increasing the FAIRness of phytolith data"

First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to this initiative! :ear_of_rice:

The _FAIR phytoliths_ project has grown from initial efforts by Emma Karoune to raise awareness on limited data sharing within the community of phytolith researchers. This initiative is supported by the International Phytolith Society ([IPS](https://phytoliths.org/)) and represents the first steps towards the [FAIRification](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) of phytolith data.

Please check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIRer_phytoliths/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) and our community's [code of conduct](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIRer_phytoliths/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to help you get started, and the [README](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIRer_phytoliths/blob/main/README.md) for an overview of the project (if you have not read it yet)!

Below you can find the main guidelines for contributing to the _FAIR phytoliths_ project. This repository is available under [CC BY 4.0 license](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIRer_phytoliths/blob/main/LICENSE.md), so you are welcome to use, reuse, remix, share and build upon the existing materials. We appreciate all your suggestions and contributions.

## How can I contribute?
Any person who deals with phytoliths, either in academia or in the private sector, can participate in this project. There are different ways in which you can contribute and hence different degrees of involvement:

* Help us to gather information about current data sharing practices and opinions on why open practices are not very common within the phytolith community and how we can improve as a community, by filling [this survey]().

* Provide phytolith datasets from South American and European studies in which you participated to help us assessing them and establishing the breadth of phytolith data (including archaeological, palaeoecological, modern botanical studies, etc.). You can send them by email at open.phytoliths@gmail.com. Datasets can be already published fully or partially, or even unpublished: we will not share them unless you give us permission to do so!

* Submitting feedback about any aspect of the project. You can reach us by email at open.phytoliths@gmail.com or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/open_phytoliths). Otherwise, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIRer_phytoliths/issues) in this repository.

* If you are willing to get more involved in this project (e. g., become a main contributor/maintainer) you can send us an email at open.phytoliths@gmail.com. Please, consider including your contact information and your motivations for becoming part of the core team of contributors.

## Acknowledgement
We value your time and effort. Once you get involved in this project in any way, we are committed to keep you updated with the results.

## Authorship of project publications
We are adopting an inclusive and generous authorship model to reflect the contributions made by the core team, active contributors and the wider phytolith community to this project. Therefore, please see our [authorship guidelines]( ) that include authorship criteria, contribution tracking and an author name ordering process.
